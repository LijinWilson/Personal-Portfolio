First we want to create an next js.
- next app create : npx create-next-app@{latest-version-number} {project-name}  npx create-next-app@13.4.8 portfolio
- run app : npx start dev
- install react icons : npm install react-icons.
- install framer motion : npm install framer motion
- here in header, the widget comes to the center as we applied the style via framer motion - 
        initial={{ y: -100, x: "-50%", opacity: 0 }}
        animate={{ y: 0, x: "-50%", opacity: 1 }}
- while adding an image from the external site for example image links: we have make changes in the next.config.json and also in the Image tag
        * we should add width, height, if not error will occur
        * the content added will be get from the error message displayed on the screen.
- while adding the group class we can style the inner element when the parent element is hovered the style will added to that child element.
- In next js we can public folder using forward slash
        eg = href="/sample.pdf"
- we can reduce the opacity of color using border-black/10
-
